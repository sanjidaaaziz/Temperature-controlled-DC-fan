Temperature Controlled DC Fan using Arduino.

This project targets the idea of controlling the speed of the fan based on the variation of temperature. Through this project we intended:
1. To build a system to detect temperature of the room and execute the contrast of the current temperature.
2. Making a system that can adjust itself to any certain temperature and execute its operations.
3. To erect a time-saving and use worthy set-up.
4. Assembling this structure to reduce the usage of electricity, minimizing power wastage and save money.

Temperature controlling is required in many places such as server rooms, houses, industries, etc. So, Arduino based temperature controlled DC fan project is very useful, which can be used anywhere. This project works in three parts:
-> At first, the sensor senses the temperature by temperature and humidity sensor namely DHT11.
-> Secondly, the sensor's output is taken and conversion of temperature value into a suitable number in Celsius scale is done. The fan speed is controlled by using PWM signals.
-> And last part of the system shows humidity and temperature on LCD and Fan runs.
